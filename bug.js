This error occurs when using the Expo CLI with a project that has a package.json file with an incorrect or missing version number for a dependency.  Expo relies on package versions for building and running projects, and an invalid version can cause the build process to fail. For example, a dependency listed as "*", an invalid version number like "1.x", or a missing version entirely can lead to this problem.  The error message may not directly point to this issue; it could manifest as a more general build or linking error.
